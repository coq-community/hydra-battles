synopsis: Exploration of some properties of Kirby and Paris' hydra battles, with the help of Coq

description: |-
  This Coq-based project has three parts:

  - An exploration of some properties of Kirby and Paris' hydra
    battles, including the study of several representations of
    ordinal numbers and a part of the so-called _Ketonen and Solovay
    machinery_ (combinatorial properties of epsilon0).

    This part also hosts the formalization by Russell O'Connor of
    primitive recursive functions and Peano arithmetic (see the
    [Goedel project](https://github.com/coq-community/goedel)).

  - Some algorithms for computing _x^n_ with as few multiplications as
    possible (using _addition chains_).

  - A bridge to definitions and results in the
    [Gaia project](https://github.com/coq-community/gaia), in particular
    on ordinals.

  Both the [documentation](https://coq-community.org/hydra-battles/doc/hydras.pdf)
  and the Coq sources are _work continuously in progress_. For more information on
  how the project is organized, maintained, and documented, see
  [this paper](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03404668), to appear
  in the proceedings of [JFLA 2022](http://jfla.inria.fr/jfla2022.html).

  ## Building and installation

  - To get the required dependencies, you can use [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org)
    or [Nix](https://nixos.org). With opam:
    - `opam install ./coq-hydra-battles.opam --deps-only` to get the _hydra battles_ dependencies;
    - `opam install ./coq-addition-chains.opam --deps-only` to get the _addition chains_ dependencies.
    - `opam install ./coq-gaia-hydras.opam --deps-only` to get the _gaia hydras_ dependencies.

    With Nix, just run `nix-shell` to get all the dependencies
    (including for building the documentation). If you only want the
    dependencies to build a sub-package, you can run one of:
    - `nix-shell --argstr job hydra-battles`
    - `nix-shell --argstr job addition-chains`
    - `nix-shell --argstr job gaia-hydras`

  - Building the PDF documentation also requires
    [Alectryon](https://github.com/cpitclaudel/alectryon) 1.4
    and [SerAPI](https://github.com/ejgallego/coq-serapi).
    See [`doc/movies/Readme.md`](doc/movies/Readme.md) for details.

  - The general Makefile is in the top directory:
    - `make` : compilation of the Coq scripts
    - `make pdf` : generation of PDF documentation as `doc/hydras.pdf`
    - `make html` : generation of HTML documentation in `theories/html`

  - You may also rely on `dune` to install just one part. Run:
    - `dune build coq-hydra-battles.install` to build only the _hydra battles_ part
    - `dune build coq-addition-chains.install` to build only the _addition chains_ part
    - `dune build coq-gaia-hydras.install` to build only the _gaia hydras_ part

  - Documentation for the `master` branch is continuously deployed at:
    - https://coq-community.org/hydra-battles/doc/hydras.pdf
    - https://coq-community.org/hydra-battles/theories/html/toc.html

  ## Contributions are welcome

  Any suggestion for improving the Coq scripts and/or the documentation will be taken into account.

  - In particular, we would be delighted to replace proofs with simpler ones, and/or to propose various proofs or definitions of the same concept, in order to illustrate different techniques and patterns. New tactics for automatizing the proofs are welcome too.

  - Along the text, we propose several _projects_, the solution of which is planned to be integrated in the development.

  - Please do not hesitate to send your remarks as GitHub issues and your suggestions of improvements (including solutions of "projects") as pull requests.
  - Of course, new topics are welcome !

  - If you wish to contribute without having to clone the project /
    install the dependencies on your machine, you may use
    [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/coq-community/hydra-battles/)
    to get an editor and all the dependencies in your browser, with
    support to open pull requests as well.
