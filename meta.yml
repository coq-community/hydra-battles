synopsis: Exploration of some properties of Kirby and Paris' hydra battles, with the help of Coq

description: |-
  This contribution contains two parts:

  - An exploration of some properties of Kirby and Paris' hydra
    battles, with the help of the **Coq** Proof assistant. This
    development includes the study of several representations of
    ordinal numbers, and a part of the so-called _Ketonen and Solovay
    machinery_ (combinatorial properties of epsilon0).

    - This project also hosts the formalization by Russel O'Connor of
      primitive recursive functions and Peano arithmetics (see
      https://github.com/coq-community/goedel)

  - Some algorithms for computing _x^n_ with as few multiplications as
    possible (using _addition chains_).

  ## Installation

  - To get the required dependencies, the easiest way is to use opam. Run:
    - `opam install coq-hydra-battles.opam --deps-only` to get the _hydra battles_ dependencies;
    - `opam install coq-addition-chains.opam --deps-only` to get the _addition chains_ dependencies.

  - Building the PDF documentation also requires Alectryon 1.2 and SerAPI.
    See [`doc/movies/Readme.md`](doc/movies/Readme.md) for details.

  - The general Makefile is in the top directory:
    - make : compilation of the Coq scripts
    - make pdf : generation of the documentation
    - make html : generation of coqdoc html files

  - You may also rely on `dune` to install just one part. Run:
    - `dune build coq-hydra-battles.install` to build only the _hydra battles_ part;
    - `dune build coq-addition-chains.install` to build only the _addition chains_ part;

   ### Documentation

   Documentation for the `master` branch is continuously deployed at:
   https://coq-community.org/hydra-battles/doc/hydras.pdf

   The command `make pdf` generates a local copy as `doc/hydras.pdf`.

  ### Exercises

  ## Contributions are welcome !

  Any suggestion for improving the Coq scripts and/or the documentation will be taken into account.

  - In particular, we would be delighted to replace proofs with simpler ones, and/or to propose various proofs or definitions of the same concept, in order to illustrate different techniques and patterns. New tactics for automatizing the proofs are welcome too.

  - Along the text, we propose several _projects_, the solution of which is planned to be integrated in the development.

  - Please do not hesitate to send your remarks as GitHub  issues and your suggestions of improvements (including solutions of "projects") as pull requests.
  - Of course, new topics are welcome !
