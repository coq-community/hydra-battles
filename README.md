This Coq-based project has three parts:

- An exploration of some properties of Kirby and Paris' hydra
  battles, including the study of several representations of
  ordinal numbers and a part of the so-called _Ketonen and Solovay
  machinery_ (combinatorial properties of epsilon0).

  This part also hosts the formalization by Russell O'Connor of
  primitive recursive functions and Peano arithmetic (see the
  [Goedel project](https://github.com/coq-community/goedel)).

- Some algorithms for computing _x^n_ with as few multiplications as
  possible (using _addition chains_).

- A bridge to definitions and results in the
  [Gaia project](https://github.com/coq-community/gaia), in particular
  on ordinals.

Both the [documentation](https://coq-community.org/hydra-battles/doc/hydras.pdf)
and the Coq sources are _work continuously in progress_. For more information on
how the project is organized, maintained, and documented, see
[this paper](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03404668), to appear
in the proceedings of [JFLA 2022](http://jfla.inria.fr/jfla2022.html).

## Building and installation

- To get the required dependencies, you can use [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org)
  or [Nix](https://nixos.org). With opam:
  - `opam install ./coq-hydra-battles.opam --deps-only` to get the _hydra battles_ dependencies;
  - `opam install ./coq-addition-chains.opam --deps-only` to get the _addition chains_ dependencies.
  - `opam install ./coq-gaia-hydras.opam --deps-only` to get the _gaia hydras_ dependencies.

  With Nix, just run `nix-shell` to get all the dependencies
  (including for building the documentation). If you only want the
  dependencies to build a sub-package, you can run one of:
  - `nix-shell --argstr job hydra-battles`
  - `nix-shell --argstr job addition-chains`
  - `nix-shell --argstr job gaia-hydras`

- Building the PDF documentation also requires
  [Alectryon](https://github.com/cpitclaudel/alectryon) 1.4
  and [SerAPI](https://github.com/ejgallego/coq-serapi).
  See [`doc/movies/Readme.md`](doc/movies/Readme.md) for details.

- The general Makefile is in the top directory:
  - `make` : compilation of the Coq scripts
  - `make pdf` : generation of PDF documentation as `doc/hydras.pdf`
  - `make html` : generation of HTML documentation in `theories/html`

- You may also rely on `dune` to install just one part. Run:
  - `dune build coq-hydra-battles.install` to build only the _hydra battles_ part
  - `dune build coq-addition-chains.install` to build only the _addition chains_ part
  - `dune build coq-gaia-hydras.install` to build only the _gaia hydras_ part

- Documentation for the `master` branch is continuously deployed at:
  - https://coq-community.org/hydra-battles/doc/hydras.pdf
  - https://coq-community.org/hydra-battles/theories/html/toc.html

## Contents

### Coq sources (directory theories)

- theories/ordinals

  - Hydra/*.v 
    - Representation in _Coq_ of hydras and hydra battles
    - A proof of termination of all hydra battles (using ordinal numbers below epsilon0)
    - A proof that no variant bounded by some ordinal less than epsilon0 can prove this termination
    - Comparison of the length of some kind of Hydra battles with the Hardy hierarchy of fast growing functions

## Contributions are welcome

Any suggestion for improving the Coq scripts and/or the documentation will be taken into account.

- In particular, we would be delighted to replace proofs with simpler ones, and/or to propose various proofs or definitions of the same concept, in order to illustrate different techniques and patterns. New tactics for automatizing the proofs are welcome too.

- Along the text, we propose several _projects_, the solution of which is planned to be integrated in the development.

- Please do not hesitate to send your remarks as GitHub issues and your suggestions of improvements (including solutions of "projects") as pull requests.
- Of course, new topics are welcome !

- If you wish to contribute without having to clone the project /
  install the dependencies on your machine, you may use
  [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/coq-community/hydra-battles/)
  to get an editor and all the dependencies in your browser, with
  support to open pull requests as well.
