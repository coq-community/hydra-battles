\chapter{Gaia and the hydras (draft)}
\index{coq}{Plug-ins!Gaia}

\section{Introduction}
The \gaia project by Jos\'e Grimm aimed to formalize mathematics in \coq in
the style of Nicolas Bourbaki. The formalization of the first book in the
Elements of Mathematics series by Bourbaki, on the theory of sets, was
initially described in a technical report in July 2009~\cite{Grimm2009a}.
The set-theoretic axioms and basic definitions in \gaia were derived
from an earlier development by Carlos Simpson~\cite{Simpson2004,CatsZFCContrib}.
Grimm then wrote (and continually updated) technical reports describing the
formalization of Bourbaki's two subsequent books~\cite{Grimm2009b,Grimm2016}
and additional topics in number theory~\cite{grimm:hal-00911710,Grimm2014},
before he passed away in 2019.

In 2020, members of \community transferred the \gaia source code to
GitHub and adapted it for recent releases of the Mathematical Components
library, which \gaia heavily relies on.
Anonymous volunteers (``collaborators of Nicolas Bourbaki'') then finished
the only in-progress proof left by Grimm. At around 155,000 LOC, \gaia is currently one of the largest maintained open source \coq projects~\cite{Gaia}.

\gaia contains definitions of ordinals in Cantor and Veblen normal form~\cite{grimm:hal-00911710}, adapted from the historical Cantor contribution~\cite{CantorContrib}. The data types for ordinals are essentially defined the same way as in \Hydras, but they are not identical inside \coq, e.g., due to residing in different modules. There are also minor differences in how ordinal arithmetic is implemented, due to the different evolutionary paths taken since divergence from the ancestor library.

As an initial step in bridging \gaia and \Hydras, we were able to establish a
correspondence between both implementations of ordinals through rewriting
lemmas. For instance, we proved that multiplication of ordinals in Cantor
normal form in \Hydras refine \gaia's corresponding multiplication operation,
and then imported \gaia's proof of associativity of the multiplication
almost for free.

The initial draft bridge code mostly uses the SSReflect proof language
and idioms from the Mathematical Components library. We made this design
decision since we believe it is less challenging to reason about
Hydra-battles code using SSReflect and MathComp than to reason about
Gaia without SSReflect.

\section{Data refinement}

\emph{The following definitions and lemmas are in
\href{../theories/html/gaia_hydras.T1Bridge.html}%
{\texttt{gaia\_hydras.T1Bridge}}}.

Since both libraries \texttt{gaia} and \texttt{hydra-battles} have their own type \texttt{T1}, we will work with the following notations.

\inputsnippets{T1Bridge/hT1gT1}

Most used constants and functions will also get standardized
non-ambiguous names.


\inputsnippets{T1Bridge/MoreNotations}



The bridge between both libraries is made of two functions.

\inputsnippets{T1Bridge/h2gG2hDef}

\inputsnippets{T1Bridge/h2gG2hRw, T1Bridge/g2hH2gRw}

The functions \texttt{iota} and \texttt{pi} allow us to define
a notion of refinement for constants, functions, predicates and relations.

\inputsnippets{T1Bridge/refineDefs}

\subsection{Examples of refinements}
Both libraries define constants like $0$, $1$, $\omega$, and arithmetic functions: successor, addition, multiplication, and exponential of base $\omega$ (function $\phi_0$). We prove consistency of these definitions. Finally, we prove that the boolean predicates `` to be in normal form'' are equivalent.

\subsubsection{A few constants}
For each constant: $0$, $1$, \dots, $n$ and $\omega$, we prove
that \texttt{hydras}' definition refines \texttt{gaia}'s.

\subsubsection{Unary functions}

\inputsnippets{T1Bridge/unaryRefs}

\subsubsection{Binary operations}
The binary operations $+$ and $\times$ are defined the same way in both libraries. Please note that they require comparison of ordinal terms. So, the proof of the following lemmas applies
compatibility lemmas like \texttt{compare\_ref} (see Section~\vref{sect:gaia-compare-ref}).

\inputsnippets{T1Bridge/plusRef, T1Bridge/multRef}


\subsection{Order and comparison}
Leibniz equality and strict order on both libraries are
compatible:
\inputsnippets{T1Bridge/eqRef}

\label{sect:gaia-compare-ref}
\inputsnippets{T1Bridge/compareRef}

\inputsnippets{T1Bridge/ltRef}

\inputsnippets{T1Bridge/decideHLtRw}

Hence, both definitions of ``being in Cantor normal form'' are
compatible.

\inputsnippets{T1Bridge/nfRef}

\section{Well formed ordinals}
For sake of compatibility, we add a clone of \texttt{hydra-battles}' type \texttt{E0} defined in \href{../theories/html/hydras.Epsilon0.E0.html}{Epsilon0.E0}.

\inputsnippets{T1Bridge/E0Def}
\inputsnippets{T1Bridge/E0EqP}

In order to import definitions and lemmas
from~\href{../theories/html/hydras.Epsilon0.E0.html}{Epsilon0.E0}, we define a pair of translations.

\inputsnippets{T1Bridge/gE0h2gG2h}

These tools allow us to import \texttt{E0.lt}'s  well-foundedness.

\inputsnippets{T1Bridge/gE0LtWf}


\section{Porting theorems without big effort}


\subsection{Porting a theorem from \gaia}
The \texttt{Gaia} library contains a proof that the multiplication of ordinals less than $\epsilon_0$ is associative.

\emph{From~\href{https://github.com/coq-community/gaia/blob/master/theories/ssete9.v}{gaia.ssete9.v}}

\begin{Coqsrc}
Lemma mulA: associative T1mul.
\end{Coqsrc}

This lemma was missing from \texttt{hydra-battles}. Nevertheless, we could adapt this lemma to \texttt{hydra-battles}' ordinals, by a small sequence of rewritings.

\inputsnippets{T1Bridge/multA}

The module~\href{../theories/html/gaia_hydras.T1Bridge_use.html}%
{\texttt{gaia\_hydras.T1Bridge\_use}} shows a small
example of importation of \texttt{multA} into \texttt{hydra-battles}' world.

\inputsnippets{T1Bridge_use/T1BridgeUse}

\subsection{Porting theorems from \Hydras}

Many lemmas of the library \texttt{ordinals/Epsilon0/} are statements about inhabitants of type \texttt{hT1}. In order to get
similar statements on \gaia's type \texttt{T1}, we prove and
apply rewriting rules of the following forms.

\inputsnippets{T1Bridge/T1leIff}
\inputsnippets{T1Bridge/rewritingRules}
\inputsnippets{T1Bridge/limitbRef}

\subsubsection{Canonical sequences}


In~\href{../theories/html/gaia_hydras.GCanon.html}%
{\texttt{gaia\_hydras.GCanon}}, canonical sequences are just imported from the library \linebreak
\href{../theories/html/hydras.Epsilon0.Canon.html}%
{\texttt{hydras.Epsilon0.Canon}}.

First, we rename \Hydras's \texttt{canon} function into
\texttt{hcanon}. Then we define a new function \emph{via} the
translations \texttt{g2h} and \texttt{h2g}.

\begin{todo}
Explain the proof !
\end{todo}

\section{Gaia's proof of well-foundedness}
The library \Hydras already contains two proofs
of well-foundedness of the strict order on ordinal terms in
Cantor normal form: a direct proof~\vref{sec:T1Wf} and a proof based on the recursive path ordering~\vref{remark:a3pat}, by
\'Evelyne Contejean. We found it interesting to comment Gaia's proof, which uses tools already present in~\cite{CantorContrib}.



This proof is quite dense and qualified as ``a bit tricky''. We just present here its main steps with the help of the \alectr tool.

The reader is invited to replay the full proof in  \href{https://github.com/coq-community/gaia/blob/master/theories/ssete9.v}{gaia.ssete9.v}, and to compare with
the proof in Section~\ref{sec:strongly-accessible}.

\begin{remark}
  The following snippets have been generated, not from
  \href{https://github.com/coq-community/gaia/blob/master/theories/ssete9.v}{gaia.ssete9.v}, but on a provisional copy:
\url{../theories/gaia/nfgaia.v} we made in order to insert comments for \alectr.  This copy is planned to be removed when we are able to add \alectr directives to a \coq source we are not allowed to modify.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Restricted recursion}
As remarked in~\vref{sec:T1Wf}, the order \texttt{T1lt} on \texttt{T1} is not well-founded, because of terms not in normal form.
But the \emph{restriction} of \texttt{T1lt} to terms in normal form \emph{is} well-founded. The following section introduces a  vocabulary in order to reason about statements of the form  ``the restriction of the relation $R$ to a subset $P$ of $A$ is well founded''.




\inputsnippets{nfwfgaia/restrictedRecursion}

The following induction principle is just a variant of \texttt{well\_founded\_induction\_type} for relations defined with \texttt{restrict}.

\inputsnippets{nfwfgaia/restrictedRecursiona}

With $P=\texttt{T1nf}$, this principle will allow us to write proofs by transfinite induction.

\subsection{Main proof steps}

\emph{Notes: the abbreviation \texttt{LT}, and the \texttt{fold LT} and \texttt{unfold LT} tactics,are not in \texttt{gaia}, but  have been added to make the goal display more readable.
The infix notation \texttt{`` \_ < \_''}  is bound to the order \texttt{T1lt} in \gaia, while,  in \Hydras,  it is bound to its restriction \texttt{LT} to terms in normal form. }

\inputsnippets{nfwfgaia/nfWfProofa}
We start with a classic structural induction on the type \texttt{T1}.

\inputsnippets{nfwfgaia/nfWfProofaa}
The following \texttt{ssreflect} tactic  pushes a new hypothesis \texttt{Hb} which --- in the same terms as in Section~\vref{sec:strongly-accessible} --- tells that any ordinal less than $a$ is ``strongly accessible''.

\inputsnippets{nfwfgaia/nfWfProofb}

The following sentence gives us the possibility of induct over \texttt{a}'s accessibility.

\inputsnippets{nfwfgaia/nfWfProofbb}


By the following two forward steps, we show that $b$ is accessible, and will be able to prove properties by induction on $b$'s accessibility.

\inputsnippets{nfwfgaia/haveHc}

\inputsnippets{nfwfgaia/haveHd}

\inputsnippets{nfwfgaia/hdProved}

Now, let us consider any ordinal term which is (by \texttt{LT}) less than \texttt{(cons a n b)}.

There are three cases to consider.
\begin{enumerate}
\item It is of the form \texttt{(cons a' n' b')} where \texttt{a'} is strictly less than \texttt{a}.
  \inputsnippets{nfwfgaia/nfWfProofd}
  
  Then, it is accessible (by hypothesis \texttt{Hb}).
  
  \item The considered term  is equal to
    \texttt{(cons a n b'')}, where $b''<\omega^a$. 
    \inputsnippets{nfwfgaia/nfWfProofg}
    
    Then we can replace \texttt{a''} with \texttt{a}, \texttt{n''} with \texttt{n}, and apply the hypotheses \texttt{Hd} and \texttt{He}.
    
\item
  The term is equal to
  \texttt{(cons a n'' b'')}, where $n''<n$ and $b''<\omega^a$.

  
  
  \inputsnippets{nfwfgaia/nfWfProofe}

  By \texttt{Hd} and \texttt{He}, and a few technical lemmas about normal forms,   the term  \texttt{(cons a n b'')} is accessible, and so is \texttt{(cons a n'' b'')}.

 
\end{enumerate}

In every case, the considered ordinal is accessible. By the definition of accessibility, the ordinal \texttt{(cons a n b)} is accessible, which ends the proof.
