\section{Generalities}

Proof assistants are excellent tools for exploring the structure of mathematical proofs,
studying  which hypotheses are really needed, and which proof patterns are useful and/or
necessary. Since the development of a theory is represented as a bunch of computer files,
everyone is able to read the proofs with an arbitrary level of detail, or to play with the theory by writing alternate proofs or definitions.


Among all the theorems proved with the help of proof assistants like \coq{}~\cite{Coq,BC04}, \hol{}~\cite{HOL}, \isabelle{}~\cite{isabelle},  etc.,
several statements and proofs  share some interesting features:
\begin{itemize}
\item Their statements are easy to understand, even by non-mathematicians
\item Their proof requires some non-trivial mathematical tools
\item Their mechanization on computer presents some methodological interest.
\end{itemize}






This is obviously the case of the four-color theorem~\cite{fourcolors}  and the Kepler conjecture~\cite{flyspeck2015}. We do not mention impressive works like the proof of the odd-order theorem ~\cite{oddorderthm}, since understanding its statement requires a quite good mathematical culture.


In this document, we present two examples which seem to have the above properties.

\begin{itemize}
\item Hydra games (a.k.a. \emph{Hydra battles}) appear in an article published in 1982 by two mathematicians:
L. Kirby and J. Paris~\cite{KP82}: \emph{Accessible Independence Results for Peano Arithmetic}. 
Although the mathematical contents of this 
paper are quite advanced, the rules of hydra battles are very easy to understand\footnote{Let us underline the analogy between hydra battles and interactive theorem proving. Hercules is the user (you!), and hydra's heads are the subgoals: you may think that applying a tactic would solve a subgoal, but it results often in the multiplication of such tasks.}.
There are now several sites on the Internet where you can find tutorials on hydra games, together with simulators you can play with. See, for instance, the blogpost and source code written by Andrej Bauer~\cite{bauer2008,BauerHydra}.




Hydra battles, as well as Goodstein sequences~\cite{goodstein_1944, KP82}
are a nice way to present complex termination problems.
The article by Kirby and Paris presents a proof of termination
based on ordinal numbers, as well as a proof that this termination is not
provable in Peano arithmetic. In the book dedicated to 
J.P. ~Jouannaud \cite{HommageJPJ}, N.~Dershowitz and G.~Moser  give a thorough survey on this topic~\cite{Dershowitz2007}.

We present a (still partial, under continuous development) implementation in \coq of the various techniques shown in
Kirby \& Paris' and Ketonen \& Solovay's~\cite{KS81} article.

\index{gaiabridge}{Introduction}
Our library \gaiaHydras is dedicated to make compatible our lemmas with José Grimm's \gaia project (designed for \ssreflect/\mathcomp) (please look at Sect.~\vref{sect:gaia-first-intro} and the paragraphs signalled with {\gaiasign}).


\item In the second part, we are interested in computing $x^n$ with the least number of multiplications as possible. We use the notion of \emph{addition chains}~\cite{brauer1939,DBLP:journals/ipl/BerstelB87}, to generate efficient certified exponentiation functions.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph*{Warning:}

This document is \emph{not} an introductory text for \coq, and there are many aspects of this proof assistant that are not covered. 
The reader should already have some basic experience with the \coq system. The Reference Manual and several tutorials are available on the \coq website~\cite{Coq}. The first chapters of textbooks like \emph{Interactive Theorem Proving and Program Development}~\cite{BC04},
\emph{Software Foundations}~\cite{SF},
\emph{Programs and Proofs}~\cite{Sergey:PnP},
or  \emph{Certified Programming with Dependent Types} ~\cite{chlipalacpdt2011} will give you the right background.

 
 
 \subsection{Structure of \Hydras}

 \Hydras is made of three main packages: \HydrasLib, \gaiaHydras, and \additions. Figure~\ref{fig:genealogy}  illustrates
 the complex relationships: inheritance from historical contributions to \coq, and dependency with other \coq packages.
 Many thanks to  Karl Palmskog and Théo Zimmermann for the CI/CD design of \Hydras and the automation of documentation maintenance.
 Please look for a more detailed description in~\cite{jfla2022}.

\subsection{Documenting theories with \alectr}

Quotations of \coq source and answers are progressively replaced from copy-pasted \emph{verbatim} to automatically generated \emph{LaTeX} blocks, using Clément Pit-Claudel's \alectr  tool~\cite{alectryonpaper, alectryongithub}.
Many thanks to Jérémy Damour, Clément Pit-Claudel  and Théo Zimmermann who designed tools for maintaining consistency between the always evolving \coq{} modules and documentation written in \emph{LaTeX}.

Besides the guarantee of consistency between theories and documentation, we hope to give a corpus for experimenting new ways of documenting the implementation of non-trivial mathematics on a proof assistant.

\subsection{Trust in our proofs}
\label{sect:trust-in-proofs}

Unlike mathematical literature, where definitions and proofs are spread out over many articles and books,
the whole proof is now inside your computer. It is composed from the \texttt{.v} files you downloaded and
parts of \coq's standard library. Thus, there is no ambiguity in our definitions and the premises of the theorems. Furthermore, you will be able to navigate through the development, using your favorite text editor or IDE, and some commands like \texttt{Search}, \texttt{Locate},  etc.



\subsection{Assumed redundancy}

It may often happen that several definitions of a given concept, or several proofs of a given theorem are possible. If all the versions present some interest, we will make them available, since each one may be of some methodological 
interest (by illustrating some tactic of proof pattern, for instance).
We use \coq's module system to make several proofs of a given theorem co-exist in our libraries (see also Sect~\vref{sect:alt-proofs}).
After some discussions of the pros and cons of each solution, we develop only one of them, leaving the others  as exercises or projects (i.e., big or difficult exercises).
In order to discuss which assumptions are really needed for proving a theorem, we will also present 
several aborted proofs.
Of course, do not hesitate to contribute nice proofs or alternative definitions!

It may also happen that some proof looks to be useless, because the proven theorem is a trivial consequence of another (also proven) result.
For instance, let us consider the three following statements:
\begin{enumerate}
\item There is no measure into $\mathbb{N}$ for proving the termination of all hydra battles (Sect~\vref{omega-case}).
\item There is no measure into the interval\,\footnote{We use the notation $[a,b)$ for denoting the set of ordinals greater or equal than $a$ and strictly less than $b$.}  $[0,\omega^2)$ for proving the termination of all hydra battles (Sect.~\vref{omega2-case}).
\item There is no measure into $[0,\mu)$ for proving the termination of all hydra battles, for any $\mu<\epsilon_0$ (Sect.\vref{sec:free-battles-case}).
\end{enumerate}

Obviously, the third theorem implies the second one, which implies the first one. So, theoretically, a library would contain only a proof of $(3)$ and remarks for $(2)$ and $(1)$. But we found it interesting to make all the three proofs available, allowing the reader to compare their common structure and notice their technical differences.
In particular, the proof of $(3)$ uses several non-trivial combinatorial properties of ordinal numbers up to $\epsilon_0$~\cite{KS81}, whilst $(1)$ and $(2)$ use simple properties of $\mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{N}^2$.


\subsection{About logic}

Most of the proofs we present are \emph{constructive}. Whenever possible, we provide the user with an associated function, which she or he can apply in \gallina{} or \ocaml{} in order to get a ``concrete'' feeling of the meaning of the considered theorem.
For instance, in Chapter~\vref{chap:ketonen}, the notion of \emph{limit ordinal} is
made more ``concrete'' thanks to a function \texttt{canon} which computes every item of a sequence which converges on a given limit ordinal $\alpha$. This simply typed function allows the user/reader to make her/his own experimentations.
For instance, one can very easily compute the $42$-nd item of a sequence which converges towards $\omega^{\omega^\omega}$.


 
Except in the \texttt{Schutte} library, dedicated to an axiomatic presentation of the set of countable ordinal numbers, all of our development is axiom-free, and respects the rules of intuitionistic logic. Note that we also use the \texttt{Equations} plug-in~\cite{sozeau:hal-01671777} in the definition of  several rapidly growing hierarchy of functions, in Chap.~\ref{chap:alpha-large}. This plug-in imports several known-as-harmless  axioms.

% \begin{Coqsrc}
% FunctionalExtensionality.functional_extensionality_dep : 
% forall (A : Type) (B : A -> Type) (f g : forall x : A, B x),
% (forall x : A, f x = g x) -> f = g
% \end{Coqsrc}

%\index{coq}{Commands!Print Assumptions}

At any place of our development, you may use the  \texttt{Print Assumptions {\it ident}} command in order to verify on which axiom the theorem {\it ident} may depend. The following example is extracted from 
Library~\href{../theories/html/hydras.Epsilon0.F_alpha.html}{hydras.Epsilon0.F\_alpha}, where we use the \texttt{coq-equations} plug-in (see Sect.~\vref{sect:wainer}).

\input{movies/snippets/F_alpha/DemoAssumptions}


\subsection{Typographical Conventions}


\subsubsection{Using \alectr}
Whenever possible, we use \alectr to display \coq code (definition, proof scripts) and answers.

Here are two  examples from Chapters~\ref{chapter:primrec}
and~\ref{chapter-powers}.

\vspace{4pt}


\input{movies/snippets/Ack/AckFixpointIterate.tex}

\inputsnippets{Fib2/fibEuclDemo}

\subsubsection{Verbatim quotations}

Quotations of \coq{} source  from others libraries (\coq's standard library, borrowed plug-ins)  are displayed as follows.

\begin{Coqsrc}
  Inductive CompareSpec (Peq Plt Pgt : Prop) :
  comparison -> Prop :=
    CompEq : Peq -> CompareSpec Peq Plt Pgt Eq
  | CompLt : Plt -> CompareSpec Peq Plt Pgt Lt
  | CompGt : Pgt -> CompareSpec Peq Plt Pgt Gt.
\end{Coqsrc}

We use also verbatim code inclusions when the examples lead to very long computations.

\begin{Coqbad}
Example C87_ok_slow : chain_correct 87 C87.
Proof.
Time slow_chain_correct_tac.
\end{Coqbad}

\begin{Coqanswer}
Finished transaction in 49.927 secs (49.445u,0.079s) (successful)
\end{Coqanswer}

\begin{Coqbad}
Qed.
\end{Coqbad}

 \subsection{Remark}
 
In general, we do not include full proof scripts in this document. The only exceptions are very short proofs (\emph{e.g.}, proofs by computation, or by application of automatic tactics). Likewise, we may display only the important steps on a long interactive proof, for instance, in the following lemma (\vref{lemma:L-2_6-1}):

\input{movies/snippets/Paths/Lemma261}


The reader may consult the full proof scripts with Proof General or CoqIDE, for instance.

\subsection{Active links}
The  links which appear in this pdf  document lead are of three possible kinds of destination:
\begin{itemize}
\item Local links to the document itself,
\item External links, mainly to \coq's website,
\item Local links to pages generated by \texttt{coqdoc}. According to the current makefile (through the commands \texttt{make html} and \texttt{make pdf}), 
  the pages generated by \texttt{coqdoc} are stored at 
the relative address \texttt{../theories/html/*.html} (from the location of the pdf).
Thus,  active links to our \coq{} modules may be incorrect if you did not get this \texttt{pdf} document by compiling the distribution available at
\url{https://github.com/coq-community/hydra-battles}.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Alternative or bad definitions}
\label{sect:alt-proofs}
Finally, we decided to include definitions or lemma statements, as well as tactics,  that lead to
dead-ends or too complex developments, with the following coloring.
Bad definitions 
 are ''masked'' inside modules called \texttt{Bad}, \texttt{Bad1}, etc.

\input{movies/snippets/Schutte_basics/BadBottoma}
\input{movies/snippets/Schutte_basics/trivialProps}
\input{movies/snippets/Schutte_basics/Failure}

Likewise, alternative, but still unexplored definitions will be presented in modules
\texttt{Alt}, \texttt{Alt1}, etc. Using these definitions is left as an implicit exercise.

\input{movies/snippets/Hydra_Definitions/HydraAlt}



\section{How to install the libraries}
\label{sec:orgheadline4}
 The present distribution has been checked with version 8.14.1 of the Coq proof assistant, with a few plug-ins. \emph{Please refer to \href{https://github.com/coq-community/hydra-battle\#readme}{the README file of the project}.}


\section{Comments on exercises and projects}

Although we do not plan to include complete solutions to the exercises, 
we think it would be useful to include comments and hints, and questions/answers from the users. In contrast, ``projects'' are supposed, once completed, to be included in the repository.

Please consult the sub-directory \texttt{exercises/} of the
 project (in construction).

Many thanks also to the Coq development team and the members of the \emph{Coq Club} for interesting discussions about the \coq{} system and the Calculus of Inductive Constructions.

The author of the present document wishes to express his gratitude to the late Patrick Dehornoy, whose talk  was determinant for our desire to work on this topic.
I owe my interest in discrete mathematics and their relation to formal proofs and functional programming  to Srecko Brlek.  Equally, there is W. H. Burge's book ``\emph{Recursive Programming Techniques}'' ~\cite{burge} which was a great  source of inspiration.

Last but not least, many thanks to Pierrette Cassou-Noguès for the watercolor on pages~\pageref{watercolorgray} and
\pageref{watercolor}. Thanks to Karl Palmskog for his
\emph{rooster hydra}, page~\pageref{roosterhydra}.


\subsection{Contributions}

Yves Bertot made nice optimizations  to algorithms presented in Chapter~\ref{chapter-powers}.
\'Evelyne Contejean contributed libraries on the recursive path ordering (\emph{rpo}) for proving the well-foundedness of our representation of $\epsilon_0$ and $\Gamma_0$.
Florian Hatat proved many useful lemmas on countable sets, which we used in our adaptation of Schütte's formalization of countable ordinals. Pascal Manoury is integrating the ordinal $\omega^\omega$ into our hierarchy of ordinal notations.

The formalization of primitive recursive functions was originally a part of  Russel O'Connor's work on G\"odel's incompleteness theorems~\cite{OConnor05}. 

\label{sec:orgheadline2}

Any form of contribution  is welcome: correction of errors (typos and more serious mistakes), improvement of
Coq scripts, proposition of inclusion of new chapters, and generally any
comment or proposition that would help us. The text contains several \emph{projects} which, when completed, may improve the present work.
Please do not hesitate to share your contributions, for instance using pull requests and issues on GitHub. Thank you in advance!

%   \item[1] This order is total, but not well-founded, because of not well formed terms.
% \item[2] Restriction of \texttt{lt} to terms in normal form; this order is partial, but well-founded.

% Some notations may belong to several scopes. For instance, ``\texttt{o<}'' is
% bound in \texttt{ON\_scope}, \texttt{E0\_scope}, \texttt{t1\_scope}, etc., and locally in several libraries.
%   \item [5] Note that there exist also various coercions from \texttt{nat} to types of ordinal. Depending on the current scope and  \coq's syntactic analysis algorithm, \texttt{F} may be left implicit.
