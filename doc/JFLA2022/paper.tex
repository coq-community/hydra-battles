\section{Introduction}
\label{sect:introduction}

\subsection{Background}

\begin{itemize}
\item formalizations of mathematics in proof assistants, such as Coq, continually grow in size and scope
\begin{itemize}
\item the Mathematical Components library and the four-color theorem and the odd order theorem in Coq
\item the Mathlib library for Lean
\end{itemize}
\item to continue to be useful as examples and reusable libraries, formalizations must be well \emph{documented} and \emph{maintained} to ensure they work with new proof assistant releases
\item Lean and Mathematical Components have accompanying books, which are written mainly to onboard new library users
\item book authors faced with several design choices: literate documents, using tools to keep the book and the proof assistant synchronized
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Vision}
The \emph{Hydra-battles} project, part of \emph{Coq-Community}~\cite{CoqCommunity} aims to be an experimental platform for the collaborative development of commented libraries of formal proofs. \emph{Coq-Community} is a community organization that we have founded in 2018 with two goals in mind: providing a solution for the long-term maintenance of interesting Coq packages, and working collaboratively on documentation projects. The \emph{Hydra-battles} project demonstrates that these two goals are not independent: interesting Coq packages can become the basis for new documentation.
%
This umbrella project now includes evolved versions of former \emph{contribs} Cantor and Additions (under the new names of Hydra-battles and Addition-chains), the Pocklington library, extracted from Russel O'Connor's Goedel \emph{contrib}~\cite{OConnor05, Goedel} and a bridge to the Gaia library (\emph{contrib} of José Grimm~\cite{Gaia,grimm:hal-00911710}).
%
By following this approach of commenting interesting Coq packages, we provide new documentation content, that contributes to the diversity of the thriving Coq documentation ecosystem.

We call on the Coq users in the JFLA community and beyond to come and join us in this effort, by bringing new interesting projects which are worth presenting to Coq learners, \emph{a.k.a.} Coq users, and guiding them in their exploration.
%
We also always have project ideas to extend further our explorations and anyone is welcome to join the team by sending small or larger contributions through pull requests.
%
The current state of the project is already the result of such evolutions after several of us contributed project solutions and new proposals to the initial version of the first author.

Futhermore, contrary to traditionally published books, the ``book'' that forms part of this project is intended to be forever evolving. As new Coq formalization patterns and proof techniques appear, the book can be adapted to demonstrate their use (in case they fit well with our applications).
%
By using modern maintenance techniques such as continuous integration and deployment, we can ensure that this documentation stays up to date with the latest Coq releases. With Alectryon~\cite{alectryonpaper, alectryongithub}, we ensure that code and documentation are always in sync.

\subsection{Hydra games}
Hydra games (also known as \emph{Hydra battles}) appear in an article published in 1982 by two mathematicians, 
Laurie Kirby and Jeff Paris: \emph{Accessible Independence Results for Peano Arithmetic}~\cite{KP82}.
This article describes a game between two players: Hercules and a hydra.
A short description of the game  can be found in~\cite{bauer2008, KP82, JFLA2018paper}. One can also play with
Andrej Bauer's simulator~\cite{BauerHydra}.
In a few words:
\begin{itemize}
\item A hydra is a finite tree, traditionally presented with the root at the bottom, the leaves of which are called \emph{heads}
  (Fig~\ref{fig:round}).
\item At every round, Hercules chops off one head of the hydra. If the head is at a distance greater than 1 from the root,
  then some sub-tree $h$ of the hydra is copied a certain amount $n$ of times. The number $n$ of copies and the sub-tree $h$ may depend of the considered variant of the game
  or the time elapsed since the beginning of the fight.
  Figure~\ref{fig:round} shows an example with $n=2$.
\end{itemize}

Kirby and Paris prove the following theorems, applying
combinatorial results about ordinal numbers by Jussi Ketonen and Robert Solovay~\cite{KS81}.

\begin{theorem}
  In the Hydra game, Hercules eventually wins, whichever the strategy of both players :
  choice of a head to chop off, choice of the number of copies. 
 \label{kp:thm1}
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
  Theorem~\ref{kp:thm1} cannot be proved in Peano Arithmetic. \label{kp:thm2}
\end{theorem}

The contrast between the simplicity of the statements above and the complexity of their proofs convinced us that it is a good theme for a commented library~\cite{HydraBattles} of formal proofs written for the \textit{Coq} proof assistant~\cite{Coq}. 

Complex formalisations and proofs are explained in an
  electronic book~\cite{HydraBook} (PDF document of over 280 pages). Whenever various reasonable choices exist, we try to present and compare the alternatives.
  For instance, Figures~\ref{fig:Ex42E0} and \ref{fig:Ex42-schutte} show two radically different proofs of the equality
  $\omega+42+\omega^2=\omega^2$. The first one is a simple proof by computation, the second one shows how this equality
  is a consequence of the axioms of the set-theoretic model  by Kurt Schütte~\cite{schutte}. 

This work is also an opportunity to 
 provide ``concrete'' examples of formalization and proof techniques: operational type classes, functions defined by  equations, dependently typed functions, etc. It may be also used as a library on ordinal numbers, for instance for proving termination properties.

 Prior stages of this project have already been presented at
 JFLA~\cite{PCiota, JFLA2018paper}.
We present recent evolutions of the library: new results, interaction within the Coq-Community project~\cite{CoqCommunity}, and documentation generated with Alectryon~\cite{alectryonpaper, alectryongithub}.

\section{Changes in the library}
The 2018 article~\cite{JFLA2018paper} contains a formal proof of  a variant of Theorem~\ref{kp:thm2}:

\begin{theorem}
  There is no termination measure mapping hydras to a segment $[0,\mu)$ where $\mu<\epsilon_0$ for proving the termination of  all hydra battles.\label{thm3}
\end{theorem}

\TODO[Clément]{Is there a word missing above?}
Considering measures applicable to \emph{all} battles allowed us to
focus on battles where the hydra can make an arbitrary number of copies at any time, which made our proof by contradiction artificially easier.
Unfortunately, the examples  most commonly shown in the litterature
(see for instance~\cite{KP82, bauer2008, BauerHydra}) 
assume that the hydra grows $n$ copies at step $n$ of the game, which is incompatible with our proof.

\vspace{6pt}

We now prove that Theorem~\ref{thm3} still holds with these typical battles by borrowing new combinatorial results from~\cite{KS81}.
Without loss of generality, we assume the following restrictions:
 
 \begin{itemize}
   \item The game starts at an initial step $i\in\mathbb{N}$ (not necessarily $0$).
   \item  The hydra is always the  representation as a tree of some ordinal strictly below $\epsilon_0$ in Cantor normal
     form. For instance, Fig~\ref{fig:round} shows the hydras respectively associated with  $\omega^{\omega^2+1}$ and $\omega^{\omega^2}\times 3$.
 
 \item Hercules always chops off the rightmost head of the hydra.
 \end{itemize}
 
 In mathematical terms, if at step $n$ the hydra is associated with the ordinal $\alpha$, at step $n+1$ it is associated with
 $\canonseq{\alpha}{n+1}$, the $(n+1)$th element of the canonical sequence of $\alpha$~\cite{KS81}.

 Our new proof of Theorem~\ref{thm3} is based on a systematic study of strictly decreasing sequences of ordinals below $\epsilon_0$, borrowed from~\cite{KS81}.
 
We also study the number of steps of a battle:
Let $\alpha<\epsilon_0$ be an ordinal.
Using the \texttt{coq-equations} plug-in~\cite{sozeau:hal-01671777}, we define the function which returns the number of steps of the battle starting with $\alpha$ at step $i$, for  any $i$ in $\mathbb{N}$.
We prove that this number is greater or equal than
$H'_\alpha(i)-i$, where $H'$ is a slight variant of the Hardy hierarchy of rapidly growing functions~\cite{BW85, KS81, Promel2013, Wainer1970}, defined by transfinite recursion in Fig.~\ref{fig:Hprime}.
From this result, we infer that the considered function is not primitive recursive in general (for $\alpha\geq\omega^\omega$).

\begin{figure}[h]
 \noindent
 For any $\alpha$ in $[0,\epsilon_0)$ and any $i$ in $\mathbb{N}$,
   \begin{itemize}
\item If $\alpha=0$, then $H'_\alpha (i)= i$.
\item If $\alpha=\beta+1$, then 
$H'_\alpha(i)=H'_\beta(i+1)$.
\item If $\alpha$ is a limit ordinal, then 
$H'_\alpha(i) = H'_{(\canonseq{\alpha}{i+1})}(i)$.
\end{itemize}

\TODO[Clément]{Highlight `Equations' and remove `omega' highlighting; change theme to something less garish}

 \TODO[Pierre]{Using equations for $H'$ as rewrite rules, we could prove nice minorations: for instance, the number $H'_{\omega^3}(3)$ has at least $2^{10^{21}}$ binary digits.}
\section{Main features}




\subsection{The Coq-Community ecosystem}
\begin{todo}
Small presentation.
\end{todo}

In order to prove formally that the length of the considered
kind of battles is not given by a primitive recursive function, we used the formalization of primitive recursive functions, part
of Russell O'Connor's contribution on G\"{o}del first incompleteness theorem~\cite{OConnor05, Goedel}.
For this purpose, and above all by consideration of the scientific interest of this contribution, we chose to host and maintain this work within \textit{Coq-Community}.

Computability is a key topic in Computer Science teaching. Moreover O'Connor's library is a nice illustration of dependently typed programming, so we chose to devote a full chapter to this formalisation, with comments on the definitions and proofs, [counter]-examples and exercises.


\subsection{Documentation with Alectryon}
\begin{todo}
  Interest of Alectryon:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Despite the frequent changes (improvements) in the Coq scripts, code inclusion and \textit{Coq}'s answers are up to date.

  \item Presentation of the main steps of proofs, possibly interleaved with text.
  \item \TODO[Clément]{A good part of the LaTeX support in Alectryon was developed for hydra-battles, and this was the first real application with a custom driver, too.}
  \item \TODO[Clément]{If you kept a trace of them, I would love to see a discussion of any errors that were caught by including the output systematically instead of copy-pasting it.}
  \item \TODO[Pierre]{the order of appearance of snippets in the book is independent from the module structure}
   \item \TODO[Pierre]{Slicing our proofs into snippets allowed to show only the main parts of our proofs (Figure~\ref{fig:Ex42-schutte}).} 
      
  \end{itemize}

   Figures~\ref{fig:Hprime} (code snippet), \ref{fig:Ex42E0} and \ref{fig:Ex42-schutte} have been generated with Alectryon.
\end{todo}

  Let us prove again the equality $\omega+42+\omega^2= \omega^2$. Let us recall that $\omega^2$ is an abbreviation of $\phi_0(2)$,
\emph{i.e} the third  additive principal ordinal.

\inputsnippets{Ex42a} 


Our proof is very different from the computational proof of
Figure~\ref{fig:Ex42E0}.
By definition of additive principal ordinals, 
it suffices to prove the inequality $\omega+42< \phi_0(2)$.

\inputsnippets{Ex42b}

Since the set \textit{AP} of additive principals  is closed under addition
(by Lemma \textit{AP\_plus\_closed}), it suffices to prove the inequalities $\omega<\phi_0(2)$ and $42<\phi_0(2)$.

\section{Conclusion and perspectives}




%\subsection{Perspectives}


The Gaia project~\cite{Gaia}, also maintained on \textit{Coq-Community} contains a development by José Grimm~\cite{grimm:hal-00911710}. This library -- dedicated  to the implementation in \textit{Coq (SSreflect)} of books from  Bourbaki's Elements of Mathematics --- contains a generalization of two types of ordinals (\texttt{T1} for the ordinal $\epsilon_0$ and
\texttt{T2} for $\Gamma_0$) to a larger ordinal defined by Ackermann, and relates these data structures with Bourbaki's set theory.
It is interesting to note that both libraries \textit{Gaia} and \textit{hydra-battles} contain their own (isomorphic but not identical) definitions of types \texttt{T1} and \texttt{T2}, both originated in~\cite{CantorContrib}.
Our plan is to build a  bridge between  the combinatorial results of \textit{hydra-battles} and the set-theoretic content of \textit{Gaia}, and make possible the transfer of theorems from one of the two libraries to the other one.

Another direction would be to write in \textit{Coq} a formal proof of the original statement of Theorem~\ref{kp:thm2}. For this purpose, we plan to import  the formalization of Peano Arithmetic by O'Connor~\cite{Goedel}.

 \emph{Hydra-battles} is not limited to the study of ordinal numbers and applications.
 For instance, we are also developing 
a module about efficient exponentiation algorithms, and hope
to extend our project to new topics.
