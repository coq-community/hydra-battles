(** * Warning


This directory contains an adaptation to Coq of the mathematical 
presentation of the set of countable ordinal numbers by K. Schutte.

In order to respect as most as possible the style of that presentation, 
we chosed to work in classical logic augmented by Hilbert's [[epsilon]]
operator. 

So, all the construction herein is powered by six axioms, three of them are
Schutte's axioms, and the other ones allow us to work in that "classical" framework, still using the Coq proof assistant and its libraries.


** Schutte's Axioms 

 We consider a type [ON] (Ordinal numbers), well-ordered by some relation 
 [lt], and such that every subset [X] of [Ord] is countable iff [X] is bounded.


[[

Axiom AX1 : WO lt.

Axiom AX2 : forall X: Ensemble Ord, (exists a,  (forall y, X y -> y < a)) ->
                                   countable X.


Axiom AX3 : forall X : Ensemble Ord,
              countable X -> 
              exists a,  forall y, X y -> y < a.

]]

** Classical logic and Hilbert style 

*** From [Coq.Logic.Classical]


[[
Axiom classic : forall P:Prop, P \/ ~ P.
]]


*** From [Coq.Logic.Epsilon]

[[

Axiom epsilon_statement :
  forall (A : Type) (P : A->Prop), inhabited A ->
    { x : A | (exists x, P x) -> P x }.

]] 


*** Needed for [epsilon] to work properly.

[[
Axiom inh_Ord : inhabited Ord.
